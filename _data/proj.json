        "description": "A summer boot camp aimed at taking graduate students from math and training them to be data scientists. Included a crash course in stochastic methods, machine learning, R, and Python. My final project trained an agent using reinforcement learning to efficiently manage incoming orders and disptach orders in a large warehouse."
